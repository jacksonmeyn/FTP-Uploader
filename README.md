# FTP-Uploader
FTP Uploader Component for JCJS Computing Project. Thanks to Steve Daniel for initial code

# About this project
This project is a C# console application that interfaces with SocialBooth software (http://www.socialbooth.com.au/) for Windows 10. 

This application will detect and upload images taken by SocialBooth in realtime to an SFTP server and create an associated MySQL database reference, ready to be used by a photobooth image management web application.

If the unique codes feature on SocialBooth is enabled, this application will detect the code associated with each image and include it in the database reference
